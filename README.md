# Movie-Ticket-Reservation-System
In this I have created a prototype for movie ticket reservation system in which user have to go various steps to book ticket
In this project, I have created a prototype to reserve a ticket for a movie 
1. User has to go through verification by entering username and password if they don't have one they can create one 
2. they have to select to book a movie or to see the past transaction
3. book a movie, select a movie of their wish from a given list select the date and number of tickets they want
4. After successful reservation users will get an SMS on their registered mobile number and have downloaded QR-Code in their folder to view the registered tickets.
5. user too can cancel the ticket once reserved if they want.
please note: As this is a prototype the SMS API is one demo version so the SMS will be delivered to only one account if I purchase API , SMS will be able to send directly to the user without changing the code much only have to remove 2 comments.

+++++++++++THIS IS A PROTOTYPE ONLY SO KINDLY GIVE SUGGESTION RATHER POINTING OUT MISTAKES++++++++++++++++
